# Event Finder - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Overview

Event Finder is a comprehensive event discovery platform that aggregates events from multiple data sources to provide users with a unified search experience. The application allows users to find events by location (ZIP code) and distance, with filtering capabilities by time frame and automatic deduplication across sources.

## Vision Statement

To create the most comprehensive and user-friendly event discovery platform that eliminates the need to search multiple websites by aggregating events from various sources into a single, intuitive interface.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality

1. **Location-Based Search**
   - ZIP code input with distance radius selection (1-100 miles)
   - Automatic geocoding and coordinate-based filtering
   - Distance calculation and display for each event

2. **Multi-Provider Event Aggregation**
   - **Ticketmaster**: 230K+ events, venue data, artist info (Priority 100)
   - **Eventbrite**: Professional events, workshops, conferences (Priority 90)
   - **SeatGeek**: Sports, entertainment, concert events (Priority 85)
   - **Meetup**: Community events, local group activities (Priority 80)
   - **Bandsintown**: Music concerts via Spotify integration (Priority 75)

3. **Time-Based Filtering**
   - Today's events
   - This week (next 7 days)
   - This month (next 30 days)
   - Next 3 months (next 90 days)

4. **Event Information Display**
   - Event title and description
   - Date, time, and venue information
   - Complete address with distance from search location
   - Event category classification
   - Source identification

### Advanced Features

5. **OAuth Integration System**
   - Foursquare OAuth for venue discovery
   - Meetup OAuth for community events
   - Spotify integration for music artist discovery
   - Graceful fallback to mock data when services unavailable

6. **Intelligent Event Deduplication**
   - Cross-provider duplicate detection
   - Priority-based event selection
   - Maintains data integrity across sources

7. **Provider Management**
   - Real-time provider availability checking
   - Automatic failover to backup data sources
   - Provider capability mapping and optimization

## User Experience

### User Flow
1. **Landing Page**: User enters ZIP code and selects distance radius
2. **Event Discovery**: System searches all available providers in parallel
3. **Results Display**: Events aggregated, deduplicated, and sorted by date
4. **Time Filtering**: User can filter results by timeframe
5. **Provider Visibility**: User can see which sources provided data

### Interface Design
- Clean, modern interface built with Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Loading states and error handling
- OAuth connection status indicators

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with server-side event aggregation
- **State Management**: React hooks with client-side state
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 for external service integration

### Data Sources Integration
- **REST APIs**: Direct integration with external event APIs
- **OAuth Providers**: Secure authentication for premium features
- **Geocoding**: ZIP code to coordinate conversion
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent request management across providers

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Event Coverage**: Number of events aggregated across all sources
- **Search Success Rate**: Percentage of searches returning relevant results
- **Provider Reliability**: Uptime and data quality across sources
- **User Engagement**: Time spent browsing events and return visits

### Secondary Metrics
- **Geographic Coverage**: ZIP codes with available events
- **Category Distribution**: Balance of event types across sources
- **Response Time**: Speed of event aggregation and display
- **Error Rate**: System reliability and fallback effectiveness

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 2 Enhancements
- User accounts and saved searches
- Event favorites and personal calendars
- Email notifications for new events
- Advanced filtering (price range, category, venue type)

### Phase 3 Expansions
- Additional data sources (Facebook Events, local government APIs)
- Machine learning recommendations
- Social features and event sharing
- Mobile application development

### Phase 4 Enterprise Features
- Event organizer dashboard
- Analytics and insights platform
- API for third-party integrations
- White-label solutions

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Limitations**: Multiple fallback data sources and mock data
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent request distribution and caching
- **Service Outages**: Provider availability monitoring and graceful degradation

### Business Risks
- **Data Quality**: Cross-validation and duplicate detection systems
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture with horizontal scaling capability
- **Compliance**: OAuth security standards and data privacy protection

## Success Criteria

### MVP Completion
- ✅ Multi-provider event aggregation (5 sources)
- ✅ Location-based search with distance filtering
- ✅ Time-based event filtering
- ✅ OAuth integration system
- ✅ Event deduplication and prioritization
- ✅ Responsive user interface
- ✅ Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Launch Ready
- Comprehensive event coverage for major metropolitan areas
- Sub-3 second average response times
- 99%+ system availability during peak usage
- Positive user feedback and engagement metrics

## Competitive Advantages
