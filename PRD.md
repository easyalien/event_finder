# Event Finder - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Overview

Event Finder is a comprehensive event discovery platform that aggregates events from multiple data sources to provide users with a unified search experience. The application allows users to find events by location (ZIP code) and distance, with filtering capabilities by time frame and automatic deduplication across sources.
